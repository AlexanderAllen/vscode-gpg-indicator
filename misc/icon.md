# Icon Design

The icon design is from these sources:

- [GnuPG logo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuPG#/media/File:Gnupg_logo.svg)
  - We slightly modify the wing outline from the original GPG lock icon.
- Color: [PANTONE 3255 C](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/3255-C)
  - We choose color based on PANTONE 3255 C, and change saturation and lightness a little bit.

## Tools

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
  - Save optimized SVG and remove metadata and comments.
